detector agnostic ml 
random distribution of parameter in simulation (slide 12)
train with previous iteration to make it easier for surrogate model
diffusion model is easy to train but slow

always start a container with geant4 outside of the process manager
maybe start with dummy models that propagate numbers
check if container has gpu for training
in first abstraction layer do not specify any training

loop might be difficult with abort criteria
make it re-launchable (save configuration of every step)
start 100s of jobs with each a container

easy interface for the end user (Start parameter, distribution, geant4, training, output)
change explicite definitions easily with base classes
