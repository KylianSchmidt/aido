### TODOs

1. Iteration and description in Simulation Parameter Dictionary is wrong after the first iteration
2. Reco Loss cannot be zero for empty events, otherwise the Optimizer gets rewarded for building a detector with thick absorbers.
3. Colors in Plotting.simulation_samples are not the same for the lines and the errorbands
